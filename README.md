# YouTube Dubbing Tool

## Overview
The YouTube Dubbing Tool automates the process of downloading YouTube videos, extracting audio, and generating multilingual dubbed versions using advanced AI technologies. This modular and flexible framework enables users to handle each step independently while ensuring easy integration for a seamless workflow.

## Features
- **YouTube Video Downloader**: Fetch videos directly from YouTube for processing.
- **Audio Extraction**: Extract and separate vocal tracks from background music.
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Transcribe spoken content into text using state-of-the-art AI models.
- **Translation**: Translate the transcribed text into multiple languages.
- **Voice Synthesis**: Generate high-quality dubbed audio tracks in various voices and accents.
- **Service Agnostic**: Modular design allows switching between APIs (e.g., YouTube API, translation services) without rewriting core components.

## Project Structure
The project is modular, with each service operating independently. Key components include:
1. **Video Download Service**:
   - Downloads YouTube videos and prepares them for processing.
   - Located in: `/services/video_download`.

2. **Audio Extraction Service**:
   - Extracts audio tracks and separates vocals from background music.
   - Located in: `/services/audio_extraction`.

3. **Transcription Service**:
   - Converts speech in audio files to text.
   - Located in: `/services/transcription`.

4. **Translation Service**:
   - Translates text into desired target languages.
   - Located in: `/services/translation`.

5. **Voice Synthesis Service**:
   - Creates AI-generated dubbed audio from translated text.
   - Located in: `/services/voice_synthesis`.

6. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Combines all services into a single automated process.
   - Located in: `/main.py`.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dddmmm789/youtube_dubbing_tool.git
   cd youtube_dubbing_tool
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Individual Services
You can run each service independently for testing:
- **Video Download**:
  ```bash
  python services/video_download/video_download.py
  ```
- **Audio Extraction**:
  ```bash
  python services/audio_extraction/audio_extraction.py
  ```
- **Transcription**:
  ```bash
  python services/transcription/transcription_service.py
  ```
- **Translation**:
  ```bash
  python services/translation/translation_service.py
  ```
- **Voice Synthesis**:
  ```bash
  python services/voice_synthesis/voice_synthesis.py
  ```

### Full Workflow
Run the main script to process a YouTube video from start to finish:
```bash
python main.py
```
Follow the prompts to specify input video, languages, and output preferences.

## Configuration
- API keys and configurations for external services (e.g., translation, voice synthesis) can be managed in `.env` or configuration files within respective service directories.
- Default configurations are included in `/config`.

## Example Output
1. A video is downloaded from YouTube.
2. Audio is extracted, and a transcription is generated.
3. The transcription is translated into a target language (e.g., Spanish).
4. A dubbed audio track is created and synchronized with the original video.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more languages.
- Enhance the synchronization of dubbed audio with video frames.
- Incorporate additional voice synthesis options for greater customization.
- Add a web interface for non-technical users.
